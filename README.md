Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy for S&P 500 ETF (IVV)
This script demonstrates a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) investment strategy applied to the S&P 500 ETF (IVV) from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2023, using historical stock price data. The DCA method involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset's price, with the goal of mitigating the effects of market volatility.

1. Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For visualizing the investment performance.
yfinance: For fetching historical stock price data.

3. Key Variables:
ticker: The stock symbol of the asset being analyzed (in this case, 'IVV', an ETF that tracks the S&P 500).
start_date and end_date: The date range for which the stock data is fetched.
interval: Defines the data frequency (monthly in this case).
amount: The fixed amount (USD 150) invested at each interval.
total_investment: Tracks the total amount invested over time.
shares: Tracks the total number of shares accumulated over time.

4. Data Fetching:
The script uses yfinance to download historical price data for the S&P 500 ETF ('IVV') over the specified time period. It fetches monthly data (interval='1mo') and resamples it to ensure it's aligned to monthly intervals.

5. Dollar-Cost Averaging Simulation:
For each month:

The script calculates how many shares are bought using the fixed investment amount (amount / row['Adj Close']).
It updates the total investment and accumulated shares.
It logs the date, the average cost per share, total investment, and the portfolio's value at the current date.

5. Final Calculations:
The script calculates the final portfolio value (the value of the accumulated shares at the most recent date) and the total profit, which is the difference between the portfolio value and the total amount invested.
6. Visualization:
The script generates a plot that visualizes:

The total portfolio value over time, based on the fluctuating stock prices and accumulated shares.
The total investment over time, which increases linearly as a fixed amount is invested each month.
This visualization provides insight into how the DCA strategy smooths out market volatility and how the portfolio's value evolves relative to the amount invested.

7. Results:
Portfolio Value: The final value of the shares accumulated over time.
Total Investment: The total amount of money invested over the time period.
Total Profit: The difference between the final portfolio value and the total investment.
This analysis helps in understanding the potential benefits of dollar-cost averaging for long-term investment in a broad market index, such as the S&P 500 ETF.

Example Chart:
The chart generated by the script shows the growth of both the total investment and the portfolio value, helping to visualize the effect of market fluctuations and investment accumulation over time.
